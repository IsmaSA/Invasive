# Do we know what 'invasive' means?

**Abstract** 	 	

Invasion science has experienced substantial growth in recent decades, yet it remains impaired by terminological inconsistencies, particularly regarding the term 'invasive'. This term lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to varying interpretations that can lead to misunderstanding. Historically, 'invasive' has been applied to describe a subset of non-native species to prioritise for management. This letter examines the proliferation of 'invasive' definitions, often reflecting the 'license' and 'creativity' of the users. Through a scoping review, we analysed the inconsistent use of the term 'invasive'. Our analysis suggest that while 'invasive' species are often labeled as such increasingly frequently based on various definitions, the term's use in scientific publications may be—in part—driven by its ability to capture scientific and media attention. We argue for a reevaluation of how the term is used in invasion science and call for a concerted effort to standardise the term.
